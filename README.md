# DEEP
Is a library for [**LÃ–VE2D**](https://love2d.org) that adds the Z axis.

**DEEP** frees you from the tedious task of rearranging your drawing order and allows you
to simply specify the z axis when drawing objects.


## Usage
To use **DEEP** in your lua files, simply `require "deep"`.

Drawing objects with **DEEP** is straightforward. Inside `love.draw()`, queue your objects up and 
then call `deep:draw()`.

To queue up your objects, simply use functions listed in [Draw Support](#Draw) like `deep:queue()` 
or `deep:rectangle()` like you wolud use their love versions.

For example:

`
deep:queue(player.sprite, player.x, player.y, player.z)
`


`deep:queue()` takes every argument that `love.graphics.draw()` does with the addition of the z axis:

`
function deep:queue(x, y, z, r, sx, sy, ox, oy, kx, ky)
`

The same applies to every function in **DEEP**.

`deep:setColor()` also works just like 

#### NOTE: only use z axis values of 0 and above

## Demos
The file `demo` has small examples of how **DEEP** should be used. I suggest you check out 
`main.lua` inside the directory to learn about more details.

Here's what it does:
